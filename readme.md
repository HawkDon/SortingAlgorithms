# Sorting algorithms

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Heap Sort
* Merge Sort
* Trie Sort

# Test case
We have been using a shakespeare text and big O to measure different types of popular sorting algorithms.

# Test results:

| Method        | Time          | Unit  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| BubbleSort    | 48,94         | ms    |
| Selection Sort| 18,29         | ms    |
| Insertion Sort| 23,17         | ms    |
| Heap Sort     | 1,72          | ms    |
| Merge Sort    | 2,35          | ms    |
| Trie Sort     | 6             | ms    |

# Conclusion
Each sorting algorithm has its pros and cons and it is important to understand which type to use for any particular use case to save performance and memory efficiency.
