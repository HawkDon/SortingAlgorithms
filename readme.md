# Sorting algorithms

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Heap Sort
* Merge Sort

# Test case
We have been using a shakespeare text and big O to measure different types of popular sorting algorithms.

# Test results:
* Bubble Sort took 48,94 milliseconds
* Selection Sort took 18,29 milliseconds
* Insertion Sort took 23,17 milliseconds
* Heap Sort took 1,72 milliseconds
* Merge Sort took 2,35 milliseconds

# Conclusion
Each sorting algorithm has its pros and cons and it is important to understand which type to use for any particular use case to save performance and memory efficiency.
